Robotrek Recombined - An SNES Game modding project

What started as an attempt to learn SNES programming and make a basic hard-type hack of the game has morphed into a much larger project.
This game was a huge favorite of mine as a kid and my interest in programming inspired me to start this work.  Changes include:

--- Re-balanced (difficult) enemies  
--- Re-balanced all properties of weapons and equipment  
--- Changed all scrap and item combinations  
--- Changed item pickups and enemy drops  
--- Brand new items to discover and create  
--- All Inventor's Friend books changed  
--- Grammar and text cleanups  
--- ASM changes and custom code to alter the mechanics of the game

This project has been challenging, and a blast to work on.  An incredible amount of thanks goes out to MissWitchy, a family member and #1 collaborator.
At this point I'm trying to decide between looking for more testing volunteers, or just releasing the game.  If anyone is interested in testing, let me know!
